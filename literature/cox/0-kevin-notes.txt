Sounds great! Regarding: " However, we should allow the user the flexibility to specify the baseline hazard function. I'll update the script correspondingly ".
We may also want to add in competing risks and accelerated failure time (AFT) models.


Competing risks: basically accounting for informative censoring; e.g., a person who dies from another cause cannot die from the cause of interest  (NB: we have not yet accounted for this in our lung cancer analyses; we may want to run an analysis with and without accounting for competing risks.). See attached article: (Austin, Circulation, 2016)


AFTs (NB: with some adaptions  that do not require parametrization of the event time distribution like suggested in the attached papers; due to having to specify the event time distribution AFTs are much less used in in medicine) have an advantage over Cox PH in that they don't require the proportional hazard assumption. See attached articles: (Orbe, 2002) and (Pang, Stat Med, 2021).


Regarding " I still need to add a discussion on the proportional hazard assumption and the concordance statistic in survival models, though."

The attached paper by Stensrud gives a nice overview of some recent examples of the PH assumption not holding in a number of recent JAMA papers (Stensrud, JAMA, 2020). With regards to the concordance statistic for survival models, I am most familiar with the (time-varying) C-statistic from Harrell (which is used in glmnet), but there are a couple of variants. I attached a paper by Austin (Austin, SMMR, 2017) that provides a nice and brief overview of a few in section 2.2.
