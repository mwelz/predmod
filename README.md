Predictive modeling of heterogeneous treatment effects in medicine.

# Todo list
* [ ] make a really simple simulation design with constant HTE (or constant within quantile group). Start with eq3 in rekkas2019; model could be confused by eq2
* [ ] update the function to only estimate stage 2 once; the current version is wrong
* [ ] write  down risk modeling mathematically nicely
