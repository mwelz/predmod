# predictive-modeling
Predictive modeling of heterogeneous treatment effects in medicine.

# Todo list

- [ ] Implement Chernozhukov models
- [ ] Risk modeling with Poisson leads to weird results, Kevin believes it occurs in the second stage and is related to w * lp, because if we do not include this interaction effect, results are good again. Experiment a bit with offset
- [ ] Write my own Hmisc::cstat to avoid the stupid package clash
- [ ] Equation 3 in rekkas2019 is discussed in the publication. Implement!
- [ ] Update the analyzer of the predictive models 
- [ ] Poisson models, build on skeleton
