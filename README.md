Predictive modeling of heterogeneous treatment effects in medicine.

# Todo list
* [ ] Make scripts more general and add the encoders and DGP to the function script. Also reorganize repo in folders
* [ ] Make a really simple simulation design with constant HTE (or constant within quantile group). Start with eq3 in rekkas2019; model could be confused by eq2
* [ ] Update the function to only estimate stage 2 once; the current version is wrong
* [ ] Write  down risk modeling mathematically nicely
