\title{Calculates imputation-uncertainty-accounted group-level benefits from a GRF model, and the associated confidence intervals.
The returned benefits are the observed and predicted absolute benefits as well as the odds ratio}
\usage{
get.benefits.grf_imputation.accounter(
  grf.model.obj_imputed,
  cutoffs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75),
  significance.level = 0.05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{grf.model.obj_imputed}{list of GRF model objects}

\item{cutoffs}{the quantile cutoff points. Default is c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), which yields the quartiles.}

\item{significance.level}{the significance level. Default is 0.05.}
