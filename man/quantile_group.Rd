\title{Partition a vector into groups based on its quantiles.}
\usage{
quantile_group(x, cutoffs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), names_quantile = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The vector to be partitioned}

\item{cutoffs}{The quantile cutoffs for the partition. Default are the quartiles: \code{c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)}.}

\item{names_quantile}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then the column names of the returned matrix are the quantiles as in \code{cutoffs}. If \code{FALSE}, the names are the numeric intervals that constitute the grouping.}
}
\value{
An object of the class \code{quantile_group}, which is a logical matrix indicating group membership
}
\description{
Partitions a vector into quantile groups and returns a logical matrix indicating group membership.
