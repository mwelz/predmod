This is the baseline DGP on which the classical methods are expected to do well. Baseline DGP: linear, no interaction effects, constant HTE in the sense that there is a constant _relative_ treatment effect. The DGP has the following properties:
- it is an RCT
- 5 iid normally distributed covariates
- constant relative risk reduction of 30%. That is, 
   Pr(Y = 1 | X, W = 1) = 0.7 * Pr(Y = 1 | X, W = 0), where Y = 1 indicates a death.
